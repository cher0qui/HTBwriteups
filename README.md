# Hack The Box Writeups (Obsidian)

This repository contains my personal Hack The Box (HTB) writeups, organized and written using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). Each writeup includes my process, notes, and techniques used to solve the machines and challenges.

> These writeups are for educational purposes only. Please avoid publishing writeups for active HTB machines.

## Structure

- Each folder corresponds to a different machine or challenge.
- Notes are written in Markdown and optimized for viewing in Obsidian.
- Tools, commands, and steps are documented for reference and learning.

## Disclaimer

These notes reflect my personal learning journey. Always follow HTB's rules and avoid spoilers for active content.
